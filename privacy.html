# Privacy Policy for "Yandex Disk: Right-click Download"

**Last updated:** December 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Yandex Disk: Right-click Download" extension ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any external servers.**

The extension operates locally on your device. It communicates directly with Yandex servers solely to perform the requested function (generating download links). We do not track your browsing history, we do not use analytics services, and we do not sell your data.

## 2. Permissions and Technical Data

To function correctly, this extension requires specific permissions. Here is how we use them:

* **Storage (`storage`):** Used solely to save your local preferences, such as the number of concurrent downloads (`maxConcurrentDownloads`), download limits (`maxItemsPerBulk`), and file extension filters (`extFilter`). These settings are stored within your browser profile via `chrome.storage.sync`.
* **Downloads (`downloads`):** Used to initiate downloads and track their progress (success or error) to manage the download queue. This data stays in your browser's memory and is cleared when the background task ends.
* **Active Tab & Scripting (`activeTab`, `scripting`):** Used to read the URL of the current tab and find Yandex Disk links on the page when you explicitly click the "Collect links" or "Download" buttons.
* **Host Permissions:** The extension connects directly to `yandex.ru`, `yadi.sk`, and `cloud-api.yandex.net` to resolve direct download links.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension is a tool to facilitate downloads from Yandex Disk. When you use this extension, your browser makes network requests directly to Yandex servers. These requests are subject to Yandex's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. The extension does not route this traffic through any intermediate servers.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
